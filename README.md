Intro to programming in Python - First steps for programming using the Python shell.

What is programming? What is Python? We'll tackle these concepts and get started working in the Python shell

### Class 2

We'll be creating small programs in the text editor, implementing control flow and loading these programs into the shell.

### Class 3

Python data structures and other essential built-ins

Lists, dictionaries and other built-in containers give the Python programmer tremendous power. We'll use these combined with other Python built-ins to process text files for information.

What is Functional Programming and how can it help make programming easier?

We'll also get started on some projects that you can do with your new Python skills.
